Awaiting the children is the Sea of Corpses\u2014the Abyss's fifth layer, and the deepest level from which a traveler can return without losing their human form.\n\nThe masked sadist Bondrewd stands between the children and the rest of their adventure. Bondrewd's horrific laboratory serves as a final checkpoint for those wishing to traverse deeper into the Abyss, and the sociopathic scientist has no desire to allow Riko's party to pass through at no cost. Deeply scarred by Bondrewd's impact on their childhood, Nanachi is engulfed in turmoil over his resurgence in their life.\n\nBondrewd's only apparent weakness is Prushka, a brash child who claims to be his daughter. Riko, Reg, and Nanachi befriend Prushka and work with the girl to overcome her father's machinations and breach the Abyss's sixth layer.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.61, "rank": 86, "popularity": 485, "num_list_users": 466771, "num_scoring_users": 259071, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2017-11-26T07:38:22+00:00", "updated_at": "2024-03-06T12:43:57+00:00", "media_type": "movie", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 2, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 8, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 10, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 58, "name": "Gore"}, {"id": 7, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}], "num_episodes": 1, "start_season": {"year": 2020, "season": "winter"}, "source": "web_manga", "average_episode_duration": 6300, "rating": "r", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/89180.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/89180l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1022/91393.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1022/91393l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1811/98157.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1811/98157l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1431/99957.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1431/99957l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1413/101908.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1413/101908l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1336/101909.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1336/101909l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1175/101926.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1175/101926l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1502/110723.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1502/110723l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1803/117183.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1803/117183l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1236/136182.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1236/136182l.jpg"}], "background": "The film was originally released on January 17, 2020 by Kadokawa in Japanese theaters, followed by an American release by Sentai Filmworks on August 14, 2020.", "studios": [{"id": 290, "name": "Kinema Citrus"}], "statistics": {"status": {"watching": "8588", "completed": "324870", "on_hold": "2096", "dropped": "852", "plan_to_watch": "130355"}, "num_list_users": 466761}, "ingestion_time": "2024-0609 18:59:30"}
