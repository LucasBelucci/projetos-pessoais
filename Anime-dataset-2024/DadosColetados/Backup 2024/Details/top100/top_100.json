After hearing Yotarou's desperate appeal for his mentorship, Yakumo is left with no choice but to accept his very first apprentice.\n\nAs he eagerly begins his training, Yotarou meets Konatsu, an abrasive young woman who has been under Yakumo's care ever since her beloved father Sukeroku Yuurakutei, another prolific rakugo performer, passed away.

Having played the role of king in the coalition battle, Zheng has the trust of the people\u2014but L\u00fc is far from out of the fight. In 18 months, he plans to interrupt Zheng's coming-of-age ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, a Zhao army numbering 20,000 troops has set out toward Qin. In the royal court, due to the lack of generals capable of responding to the incoming threat, L\u00fc slyly suggests that Zheng take command. However, Cheng Jiao, Zheng's half-brother, volunteers instead. As they grew to trust each other during the coalition battle, Zheng now accepts Jiao as his replacement.\n\nHowever, the Zhao forces retreat a mere half-day after clashing with Jiao's army. With trouble quickly brewing in the shadows, the internal struggle of Qin is only complicated further. There are only two men Zheng feels he can rely on: Bi, a general who commands 30,000 men; and Xin, the leader of the Fei Xin force.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n", "mean": 8.74, "rank": 47, "popularity": 2716, "num_list_users": 65559, "num_scoring_users": 27993, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2021-10-17T17:36:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-01-06T14:52:30+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Military"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Seinen"}], "num_episodes": 26, "start_season": {"year": 2022, "season": "spring"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "sunday", "start_time": "00:00"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1495, "rating": "r", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1152/118865.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1152/118865l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1595/121005.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1595/121005l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1892/122522.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1892/122522l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1915/122658.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1915/122658l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1566/122794.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1566/122794l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1406/123855.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1406/123855l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1552/125124.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1552/125124l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1748/134470.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1748/134470l.jpg"}], "background": "Kingdom 4th Season adapts chapters 364-441 of the original manga.\n\nKingdom 4th Season was released on Blu-ray in three volumes from August 26, 2022 to November 25, 2022.", "studios": [{"id": 1, "name": "Pierrot"}, {"id": 1998, "name": "Studio Signpost"}], "statistics": {"status": {"watching": "8495", "completed": "31383", "on_hold": "1104", "dropped": "718", "plan_to_watch": "23854"}, "num_list_users": 65554}, "ingestion_time": "2024-0609 18:58:58"}, {"id": 2921, "title": "Ashita no Joe 2", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/45028.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/45028l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Rocky Joe 2"], "en": "Tomorrow's Joe 2", "ja": "\u3042\u3057\u305f\u306e\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\uff12"}, "start_date": "1980-10-13", "end_date": "1981-08-31", "synopsis": "Yabuki Joe is left downhearted and hopeless after a certain tragic event.

The subsequent trip leads to a clash between Peco and Kong Wenge, who overwhelmingly defeats the former in one game.
