The Kiheitai present Gintoki with a job: find Takasugi, who has been missing since his ship was ambushed in a Harusame raid. Nobume also makes a stunning revelation regarding the Tendoushuu, a secret organization pulling the strings of numerous factions, and their leader Utsuro, the shadowy figure with an uncanny resemblance to Gintoki's former teacher.\n\nHitching a ride on Sakamoto's space ship, the Yorozuya and Katsura set out for Rakuyou, Kagura's home planet, where the various factions have gathered and tensions are brewing. Long-held grudges, political infighting, and the Tendoushuu's sinister overarching plan finally culminate into a massive, decisive battle on Rakuyou.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "mean": 8.98, "rank": 14, "popularity": 783, "num_list_users": 325965, "num_scoring_users": 150979, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2016-09-21T07:58:22+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-04-02T18:14:16+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 4, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 57, "name": "Gag Humor"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Parody"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Samurai"}, {"id": 24, "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Shounen"}], "num_episodes": 12, "start_season": {"year": 2017, "season": "winter"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "monday", "start_time": "01:35"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1440, "rating": "pg_13", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/82056.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/82056l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/83077.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/83077l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/83132.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/83132l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/83412.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/83412l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/83528.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/83528l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1131/134947.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1131/134947l.jpg"}], "background": "", "studios": [{"id": 1258, "name": "Bandai Namco Pictures"}], "statistics": {"status": {"watching": "16253", "completed": "189988", "on_hold": "5021", "dropped": "3661", "plan_to_watch": "111033"}, "num_list_users": 325956}, "ingestion_time": "2025-0107 21:44:47"}, {"id": 42938, "title": "Fruits Basket: The Final", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1085/114792.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1085/114792l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["Fruits Basket 3rd Season", "Fruits Basket (2019) 3rd Season", "Furuba"], "en": "Fruits Basket: The Final Season", "ja": "\u30d5\u30eb\u30fc\u30c4\u30d0\u30b9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8 The Final"}, "start_date": "2021-04-06", "end_date": "2021-06-29", "synopsis": "Hundreds of years ago, the Chinese zodiac spirits and their god swore to stay together eternally.

Satellite channel WOWOW picked up the series in the fall of that year and aired it in its entirety uncensored. Cowboy Bebop was not a ratings hit in Japan, but sold over 19,000 DVD units in the initial release run, and 81,000 overall.

In 18 months, he plans to interrupt Zheng's coming-of-age ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, a Zhao army numbering 20,000 troops has set out toward Qin. In the royal court, due to the lack of generals capable of responding to the incoming threat, L\u00fc slyly suggests that Zheng take command. However, Cheng Jiao, Zheng's half-brother, volunteers instead. As they grew to trust each other during the coalition battle, Zheng now accepts Jiao as his replacement.\n\nHowever, the Zhao forces retreat a mere half-day after clashing with Jiao's army. With trouble quickly brewing in the shadows, the internal struggle of Qin is only complicated further. There are only two men Zheng feels he can rely on: Bi, a general who commands 30,000 men; and Xin, the leader of the Fei Xin force.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n", "mean": 8.73, "rank": 51, "popularity": 2701, "num_list_users": 72108, "num_scoring_users": 31397, "nsfw": "white", "created_at": "2021-10-17T17:36:00+00:00", "updated_at": "2023-01-06T14:52:30+00:00", "media_type": "tv", "status": "finished_airing", "genres": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 13, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Military"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Seinen"}], "num_episodes": 26, "start_season": {"year": 2022, "season": "spring"}, "broadcast": {"day_of_the_week": "sunday", "start_time": "00:00"}, "source": "manga", "average_episode_duration": 1495, "rating": "r", "pictures": [{"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1152/118865.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1152/118865l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1595/121005.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1595/121005l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1892/122522.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1892/122522l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1915/122658.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1915/122658l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1566/122794.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1566/122794l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1406/123855.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1406/123855l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1552/125124.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1552/125124l.jpg"}, {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1748/134470.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1748/134470l.jpg"}], "background": "Kingdom 4th Season adapts chapters 364-441 of the original manga.\n\nKingdom 4th Season was released on Blu-ray in three volumes from August 26, 2022 to November 25, 2022.", "studios": [{"id": 1, "name": "Pierrot"}, {"id": 1998, "name": "Studio Signpost"}], "statistics": {"status": {"watching": "8601", "completed": "36319", "on_hold": "1195", "dropped": "799", "plan_to_watch": "25184"}, "num_list_users": 72098}, "ingestion_time": "2025-0107 21:45:22"}, {"id": 21, "title": "One Piece", "main_picture": {"medium": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1244/138851.jpg", "large": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1244/138851l.jpg"}, "alternative_titles": {"synonyms": ["OP"], "en": "One Piece", "ja": "ONE PIECE"}, "start_date": "1999-10-20", "synopsis": "Barely surviving in a barrel after passing through a terrible whirlpool at sea, carefree Monkey D.
